Vol. 30: Inhumane Demonic Shinjuku Showdown -Life & Death-
Vol. 31: From Here On Out
Yuji Itadori went from looking up to looking down on you
Sukuna still sticking out his to tongue and pulling out his 2nd mouth
The perfect cover ending and tribute to Vol. 1

The smartest decision Gege Akutami made in his entire career is to not have a public social media account and I will stand by that

- JJK final volumes 29-30 releasing Dec 25th
- MHA final volume 42 releasing Dec 4th
- OnK final volume 16 is out Dec 18th

Damn 2024 is really the end of an era 😭😭

TITE KUBO on his favorite battle in JJK, 𝙈𝙖𝙠𝙞 𝙕𝙚𝙣𝙞𝙣 𝙫𝙨. 𝙊𝙜𝙞 𝙕𝙚𝙣𝙞𝙣, 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙆𝙪𝙠𝙪𝙧𝙪 𝙎𝙦𝙪𝙖𝙙, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙃𝙚𝙞:

“The story follows Akutami's signature flashbacks that alternate between fact and fiction as he does his best to avoid explanations of complex Cursed Techniques, a general feature of Jujutsu battles; it’s followed by a succession of incredible-looking CTs easy to understand at a glance and a series of battles filled with so much gore it makes me jealous of how Jump’s standards have been relaxed; along with a mountains of corpses.

The transition towards Naoya’s battle is exhilarating and perfect. THIS is what it means to be in the artist’s zone.”

GEGE AKUTAMI on his favorite battle in MHA, 𝙈𝙞𝙧𝙠𝙤 𝙫𝙨. 𝙉𝙤𝙢𝙪 (𝙃𝙞𝙜𝙝 𝙀𝙣𝙙):

“Mirko is a character we've only met once during this time, but her tenacity and down-to-earth nature as she uses a simple quirk to counter the Nomu, whose powerful quirks keep popping out one after another, instantly captivated readers.

To piggyback off of the relatively more chill battles of the Endeavor Office arc, Mirko’s charm popped off by utilizing elements planted beforehand, such as the high-end sadism sprinkled by Endeavor and the named high-ranking heroes, while at the same time, the brutal PLUS ULTRA drew a strong line for readers about the story’s intensity from here on out.”

DAIMA, Dandadan, BLEACH, Blue Box, ReZero, Ranma, Fairy Tail, SAO, Amagami-san, etc

Old and new anime titans running fall season just hits on a completely different league. 2024 has been the gold standard for anime

Gege: In the given context [of striking air surfaces with Cursed Energy], I intended to convey just how deep Higuruma’s talent as a sorcerer went. (Vol. 28)

“Gojo-level talent” doesn’t cut it anymore I think he was destined to be the MC in another series but cursed to be in JJK

Leaks and leakers absolutely ruined the JJK community and experience. They’ll ruin other series too

Praying one day all these jobless bums get caught & sent to jail to rot for the rest of their miserable lives

I still remember when Gege took an indefinite hiatus after Ch. 152 due to long-term health issues

Came back in one month, proceeded to deliver weekly peak that was Culling Game and Shinjuku Showdown

I hope this time he takes a good long rest before starting on his next work

This is the last time we saw Takako Uro

Naked woman, fashion nova, captain of the squad that did nothing but job to Sukuna

We never saw her death or get chased by Kenjaku, likely she’s still alive. I see this as an absolute W

Written on Sukuna’s box [推魔怨敵] (Saimaonteki) is an old divine protection that was later adapted to Shingon Buddhism (founded in Heian era)

An extremely powerful ritual said to annihilate demons & enemies existing in this world

A befitting end to Sukuna’s malevolent story

Note this is also the same box and ward used in Chapter 1

Sukuna’s finger, a curse so powerful not even the strongest anti-demonic spells could do much to suppress it

Now it’s just an empty charm. Yuji’s words recognize the cycle of death & rebirth that has come full circle

Among everyone, there was one person whom he has NEVER disrespected nor talked shit about

How could someone who lives at the top in solitary be so generous to this person?

Uraume was special to him. These moments simply hit so much harder now, they make me smile

My translation of Mahito and Sukuna's conversation

Sukuna once said defeat might as well be death to him. In losing, he could no longer refute the ideals opposing him

He took on Yuji's advice to live for someone rather than for himself

While Gojo went South. Sukuna went North

The one on his left is likely a younger Uraume

The one on his right appears to be a new woman. It is likely not Yorozu given she was often naked with no ponytail ornament

Could this be the person implied whom Sukuna knew where ‘love’ came from?

Sukuna being the ambiguous open ending Gege left for us is some crazy work

My translation of Gojo and Yuji’s final conversation. The title of #JJK271 references words of the disgraced Curse User

Just as Kenjaku had his own will to pass on, so did Gojo. A will & dream for the next generation to provide a more compassionate & better environment for future sorcerers

That just may be what it means to have a different strength from that of Gojo

There’s just no doubt in my mind now. Satoru Gojo and Ryomen Sukuna are the two greatest generational characters of this era

Nobody else moved the entire world like they did

So happy that all the Shonen Jump mangakas paid their respects to Gege Akutami. He deserves his flowers for giving us such a generational series that went crazy worldwide

But I’ll never forgive him for excluding Yuki from the color spread

#ThankYouGegeAkutami #JJK271
All the congrats and flowers from the current mangakas

Sad One Piece wasn’t on this week for Oda give his flowers

“Akutami-sensei, congratulations. Please come back to do more time in Hell after taking a good long break”Shinohara-sensei is foul for this 😂😭

“End of a Dream.” An ending where everyone atones and happy days continue

Kenjaku once said the space between dreams and reality is an enchantment (まじない) — a protection against evil

Expect nothing or the most meta-disturbing conclusion to his story ever
